To check the Melos command and experiment how it could it be used


# Melos is a CLI tool used to help manage Dart projects with multiple packages (also known as mono-repos)

Splitting up large code bases into separate independently versioned packages is extremely useful for code sharing. However, making changes across many repositories is messy and difficult to track, and testing across repositories gets complicated. Melos helps solve these issues by allowing multiple packages to work together within one repository, whilst being totally independent of each other. Features include:

Automatic versioning & changelog generation.
Automated publishing of packages to pub.dev.
Local package linking and installation.
Executing simultaneous commands across packages.
Listing of local packages & their dependencies.
